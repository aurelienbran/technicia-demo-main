# Current State - TechnicIA Project

## Context for Next Discussion

We are developing TechnicIA, a technical documentation assistant. Here's what has been done:

### Infrastructure Status
- FastAPI backend with basic endpoints
  - `/` for health check ✅
  - `/api/query` for test response ✅
- Tests implemented and passing
- Virtual environment configured

### Project Structure
```
technicia-demo-main/
├── backend/
│   ├── main.py           # Basic FastAPI setup
│   ├── docs/             # PDF storage
│   └── venv/             # Virtual environment
├── tests/
│   └── test_system.py    # Working test suite
└── docs/
    └── setup_phase.md    # Setup documentation
```

### Current Working State
1. Server runs with:
```bash
cd backend
.\venv\Scripts\activate
uvicorn main:app --reload
```

2. Tests pass with:
```bash
python tests/test_system.py
```

### Next Steps to Discuss
Ready to implement PDF indexing:
1. Qdrant setup for vector storage
2. PDF processing with embeddings
3. Integration with Voyage AI for vectorization

### Required Decisions
1. Choice of PDF processing library
2. Embedding strategy
3. Vector storage configuration

### Note
All basic endpoints are working, and we have a clean test structure. The focus now is on implementing PDF indexing and semantic search capabilities.

## Prompt for Continuation
Please help me with the next phase of TechnicIA development. We have successfully set up the basic infrastructure (FastAPI backend, tests, and virtual environment). Now, we need to implement PDF indexing functionality. Where should we start? Options include:

1. Setting up Qdrant for vector storage
2. Implementing PDF processing
3. Configuring Voyage AI for vectorization

What do you recommend as the first step, and how should we proceed?
